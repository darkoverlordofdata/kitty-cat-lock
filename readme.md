# catlock

## A cat proof screen lock inspired by catlock

###  What is cat proof?

Screen lock programs can get pretty complex, as they can allow you to do things such as adjust your volume or disable wifi without unlocking your screen.

But Bal jumps on, lays on, and attacks my keyboard. She has, among other things, filled my hard drive with screen captures in chromeos, frozen mate screenlock, leading to a hard reboot, and even crashed catlock, letting her do further evil things to my computer,

All of this cool functionality has been stripped out of catlock - it does 2 things:

* display the date and time
* accept your password

Bal has 'paw-tested' catlock, and has not been able to do anything to my computer!


oops:
sudo chmod 755 /usr/local/bin/catlock
sudo chmod u+s /usr/local/bin/catlock

testing: sudo ./catlock -t badabing  -o -a darko
