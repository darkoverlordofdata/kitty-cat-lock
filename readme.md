# kitty-cat-lock

## A cat proof screen lock inspired by metalock

###  What is cat proof?

Screen lock programs can get pretty complex, as they can allow you to do things such as adjust your volume or disable wifi without unlocking your screen.

But Bal jumps on, lays on, and attacks my keyboard. She has, among other things, filled my hard drive with screen captures, frozen screenlock so I have to reboot, and even crashed the screen lock, letting her do further evil things to my computer,

All of this cool functionality has been stripped out of kitty-cat-lock - it does 2 things:

* display the date and time
* accept your password

Bal has 'paw-tested' kitty-locker, and has not been able to do anything to my computer!
